<h1> Average Airline Delay Analysis with nycflights13 Dataset</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>


This project analyzes flight data from the nycflights13 dataset to report on the average delay time for each airline, helping our client make informed decisions about airline reliability. Using the Tidyverse suite in R, we apply various data wrangling techniques to produce an ordered table that shows each airlineâ€™s average delay.
